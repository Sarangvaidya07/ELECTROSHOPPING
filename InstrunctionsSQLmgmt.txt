Dear All,
I am sending mySql Server Management Console Project (Version 1). 
You can show this project in ur college as it is or after some changes according to your requirement. 
But if you will make some changes then only you would understand the code, so make changes in the project. 
Rest I have not considered much the look and feel of the project so make it as per your need.


This project has almost all basic functionalities like
1. You can view your mysql Database in tree form
2. 
You can Create and delete database
3. You can create and delete table
4. 
you can open table and show all records in tabular form
5. 
You can write custom query and execute it

So make the changes and additions in the project according to your requirement, best of luck.


Regards


Anil Singh
